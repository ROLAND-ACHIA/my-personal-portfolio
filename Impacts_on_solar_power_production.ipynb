    "![Heatmap](./2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**  \n",
    "- **Wind speed has a weak correlation with solar power output**, unlike radiation, which has a strong positive correlation (0.79).  \n",
    "- **Moderate wind speeds may have a minor positive effect** due to panel cooling.  \n",

    "The scatter plot below visualizes the relationship between **wind speed** and **solar power output (System Production)**.  \n",
    "Each point on the plot represents an observation, showing how variations in wind speed correspond to changes in energy generation.  \n",
    "From this scatter plot, we can see that wind speed has a **significant positive, negative, or negligible effect** on solar power production.  \n",

    "\n",
    "![Scatter Plot](./3_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Observations:**\n",
    " **Diverse Distribution of Data Points:**  \n",
    "   - The data points are spread across various wind speeds, ranging approximately from **0 to 10 m/s**.  \n",
    "   - Most values are concentrated in the **lower wind speed range (0–5 m/s)**, indicating that the dataset primarily consists of observations with mild to moderate wind conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    " **System Production Peaks at Moderate Wind Speeds:**  \n",
    "   - The highest solar power production values (above **7000 kWh**) are observed at wind speeds between **2 to 5 m/s**.  \n",
    "   - This suggests that **moderate wind speeds may contribute positively** to solar energy generation, likely by preventing panel overheating through cooling effects.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Decreasing Trend at Higher Wind Speeds:**  \n",
    "   - Beyond **6 m/s**, there is a noticeable decline in system production, with fewer high-output observations.  \n",
    "   - This could be due to **increased dust accumulation, vibrations, or mechanical stress** on solar panels at higher wind speeds, which might reduce efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Cluster of Low-Output Observations:**  \n",
    "   - A significant number of points are clustered at **0 kWh**, spread across all wind speeds.  \n",
    "   - These could represent periods of **nighttime, system downtime, or other operational interruptions**.\n",
    "### **Histogram: Wind Speed Distribution**\n",
    "The histogram below shows the **distribution of wind speeds** in the dataset, providing insights into how frequently different wind speed values occur.  \n",
    "From this distribution, we can observe that the dataset is dominated by **low, moderate, or high wind speeds**, which helps in understanding their potential impact on solar power production.  \n",
    "A concentration of data points in the **low-wind-speed range**  indicate that most observations experience minimal wind effects, whereas a wider spread toward **higher wind speeds** could suggest a greater influence on solar panel performance.  \n",
    "This visualization is essential for assessing whether wind speed variations play a significant role in energy generation patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Histogram](./4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**  \n",
    "- Most recorded wind speeds fall within the **low to moderate range (0-7 m/s)**.  \n",
    "- There are fewer instances of extremely high wind speeds.  \n",
    "- This suggests that in most cases, wind speeds are unlikely to significantly impact solar production.  \n",

    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "This analysis highlights that while **wind speed alone does not directly contribute to solar power production**, it plays a significant indirect role in influencing panel performance and efficiency.  \n",
    "One of the key benefits of wind speed is its **cooling effect**, where moderate wind speeds help **dissipate excess heat**, preventing solar panels from overheating and thereby slightly improving efficiency.  \n",
    "However, higher wind speeds can also introduce challenges, particularly by **increasing dust accumulation** on panel surfaces, which can block sunlight and reduce energy absorption over time.  \n",
    "Additionally, **structural considerations** must be taken into account, as excessive wind speeds can create **mechanical stress, vibrations, or misalignment** of solar panels, potentially affecting long-term stability and energy output.  \n",
    "Overall, the influence of wind speed on solar power generation is **highly context-dependent**, with **both beneficial and adverse effects** depending on wind intensity, environmental conditions, and panel design.  \n",
    "Understanding these factors is crucial for optimizing solar panel placement, maintenance strategies, and long-term energy efficiency in various wind conditions.  \n",
